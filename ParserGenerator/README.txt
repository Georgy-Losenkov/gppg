
README file for gppg\ParserGenerator

Question:  Where are GplexBuffers.cs, Parser.cs, Scanner.cs and ScanAction.cs?

Answer:  
These four files are not part of the Source-Controlled distribution. 
These files are produced from specifications at the beginning of the build, from gppg.lex, gppg.y, 
ScanAction.lex and the embedded resources of gplex.
